                        We do not know why Jesse died. He seemed happy and healthy when he last spoke to his father on the 7th
                        for their daily work check-in. That was the last time he was heard from.

                        Jesse was found dead in his Boise apartment on November 12th. An autopsy done by the Boise coroner was inconclusive.

                        He is survived by his sisters, Sarah and Mary, and his parents, Jeff and Gayle.

                        We plan to hold a memorial celebration for Jesse at his childhoold home in Mountain View in early spring 2023.
